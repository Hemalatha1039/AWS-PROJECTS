Deploy a Web App on Nginx Server using AWS ECR, AWS ECS and AWS Fargate 

Prerequisites 

Before starting this tutorial, you will need: 

1. An AWS account ( IAM user with required permission to work with AWS ECR, AWS ECS and AWS Fargate)

2. AWS Command Line Interface installed and configured.  

3. Docker Engine installed, and the application started. 

4. Visual Studio Code installed.   

---------------------------------
Step 1: Create a Container Image 
---------------------------------
In this step, you will create a container image of a sample web app. 

1. In a new terminal window, run the following commands to create a new folder called nginx-web-app, and navigate to the folder. 

mkdir nginx-web-app 

cd nginx-web-app 

2. On your local machine, navigate to the Visual Studio Code application, and open the nginx-web-app folder. 

3. In the Explorer section, select the +New file icon, and enter index.html for the file name. 

4. Select the index.html file and update it with the following code. Then, save the file. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Sample Web App</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light; }
body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
font-family: Amazon Ember, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to AWS ECS and Fargate hands-on !</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>
<p><em>Thank you !</em></p>
</body>
</html>

5. Create another file named Dockerfile, and update it with the following code. Then, save the file. 

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 nginx:latest 

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html 

COPY index.html index.html 

6. In the open terminal window, run the following command to create container image. 

docker build -t nginx-web-app . 

-------------------------------------------
Step 2: Push Container Image to Amazon ECR 
-------------------------------------------
In this step, you will create a private repository in Amazon ECR and push the container image you built in previous module to the newly created repository. 

1. Sign in to the AWS Management console in a new browser window, and open the Amazon Elastic Container Registry at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/home. 

2. For Create a repository, choose Create. 

3. On the Create repository page, for Repository name enter nginx-web-app, leave the default selections, and select Create repository. 

4. Once the repository has been created, select the radio button for the repository, and then select View push commands 

5. Follow all the steps in the pop-up window, to authenticate and push the image to the repository.
